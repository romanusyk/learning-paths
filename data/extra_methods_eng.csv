2,"Now I'm trying to at least move forward a little in learning English using word cards, and repeating learned words that are remembered quite well over time. Also, over time, watching movies in English or just with subtitles, you notice these new learned words more often.
In the future, I plan to study individually with a teacher, as I think this is the best way to improve my English, but it is also important to determine the specific need and which aspect should be improved."
3,"Attempts to speak or try to perceive information, movies, books, and games in English without prior knowledge of the language."
5,"specially prepared materials for drills, translating on the fly, q&a, which you work on for about a week and work out loud.

drills - the speaker reads the text in English and pauses after each sentence and you need to repeat the sentence

translating on the fly - the speaker reads a sentence in Ukrainian and pauses for you to translate that sentence and then he reads that sentence in English and you compare with your version

q&a - the speaker reads a sentence in English and then asks a question in English to that sentence, you have to answer the question based on the sentence that was read, then the speaker reads the correct answer and you compare with your version"

32,"No, I use the well-known ones. But I want to try an AI app"
33,Going to a language environment
38,"Very effective:
-Teaching someone, creating educational content. While you are compiling materials and explaining, you remember and practice yourself
-Immerse yourself in an English-speaking environment where there is simply no other option but to use English
-Keeping a diary, blog in English, writing notes
-Hobbies in English
-Meetings with friends in English
-Games for every day. I love playing DaNi or Cow)
-Learning another language, where the teacher explains in English. I tried to get into Italian like that. It was interesting:) You learn a new word in Italian, and you ask in English about the rules of use, for example. It relieves the tension of saying something in English, you remember words, you think in English like a native.

Ineffective
-10 applications at once, it is difficult to study systematically like that
- Classic groups. I always feel sorry for the time
- General IT English. As a designer, I don't like learning about tokens with programmers. There is little of this communication in life, it does not fall into my interests. And it becomes boring to learn because of this. But small talk or crisis communications are useful topics. Here selectively
-Learning words without context
-Doing 2 exercises on a rule for new grammar. It seems like you did it, but you forgot it a week later. It's good if there are simulators and to automatism, or repeat through intervals"

etymological dictionary is effective"
76,ENG program
77,everyday communication
80,"Similar to what has already been mentioned, but I decided to clarify - watching videos/movies with subtitles (English audio and English subtitles). You read and listen at the same time)

In addition, I think it's a good idea to set English as the main language wherever possible (for example, on your phone). This will not allow you to learn ""new"" things, but it adds a sense of an English-speaking environment)"
