2,"Before entering graduate school, I tried to learn English using various methods (effortless English, watching professional courses in English, practicing pronunciation), but due to a trauma in learning English in graduate school, where the teachers were just annoying me by making us translate articles from English to Ukrainian right next to her out loud, the desire to learn disappeared completely. And it is still quite difficult to force myself to learn English by taking courses or reading books. I think I will try personal lessons, although the current level is enough for professional needs."
3,"I never started and, as a result, never stopped learning English. All my life I have not been shy about reading English articles or watching movies in English. At first, some details were not clear, but over time, translating unfamiliar words and seeing specific sentences and how words are used in context, my level of knowledge improved."
4,"Loss of motivation (laziness).
Boring group classes.
Monotonous classes with a teacher (non-native)."

16,"Lack of need and, as a result, motivation"

20,"Yes, when I studied only for myself and it was not yet needed for work"
23,"Yes, when another foreign language was more of a priority than English at that time"
26,"It became uninteresting, the efforts invested did not give an equivalent result, the external pressure was inadequately strong, causing resistance"
27,"I didn't stop, but my knowledge deteriorated and I lost motivation in elementary school because of a teacher with poor teaching methods (memorizing texts and reciting them by heart, etc.), but it improved when he was replaced"

37,"I stopped because I didn't have a clear need for it, the classes were boring"
38,"- The school changed its strategy. They changed the content on the platform. There was more AI and less feedback, exercises. It became more like a toy
- The teacher was not a good fit
- There was no balance of skills. Boring grammar or words without using them
- Gamification more than quality of education. I realized that I was learning something to beat someone in the ranking. And from there I learned haphazardly, but faster
- Uninteresting content (topics). It's a real torture, you force yourself to do something
- I didn't feel the result. You're spinning your wheels
- I didn't go to English at work because I didn't want to discuss personal things with colleagues. Uncomfortable
- Fear of speaking with native speakers"
39,"I stopped several times, usually the reason was that I didn't have enough time or energy to do homework. And without independent work, the result is not so obvious. Another point is that in work you often use the same phrases, which is quite шаблонно and also does not contribute to development."

45,1) There was no goal. 2) I didn't see progress

54,"Yes, I stopped because I was stupid."
56,I needed a vacation
58,"I finished one course and was moved onto next one. I didn’t like either the new teacher, or new classmates (they didn’t like me too, I think)."

73,because of the teacher and a change of priorities
76,There was no need at work
81,"I have not been purposefully studying English for a long time, since my level is quite sufficient for professional or everyday use. But something new is always found"

84,gap in time between university and the beginning of work in IT (10 years)
86,"Lack of result, lack of purpose"
