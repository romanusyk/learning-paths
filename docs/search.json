І досі доволі важко змусити себе вчити англійську проходячи курси чи читаючи книжки. Думаю спробувати персональні заняття, хоча й теперішнього рівня вистачає для професійних потреб.Before entering graduate school, I tried to learn English using various methods (effortless English, watching professional courses in English, practicing pronunciation), but due to a trauma in learning English in graduate school, where the teachers were just annoying me by making us translate articles from English to Ukrainian right next to her out loud, the desire to learn disappeared completely. And it is still quite difficult to force myself to learn English by taking courses or reading books. I think I will try personal lessons, although the current level is enough for professional needs.\nPoor teaching or methodsLoss of motivationNo practical need\n\n\nЯ ніколи не починав та, як наслідок, не припиняв вивчення англійської мови. Я усе життя не цурався читати англомовні статті або дивитись фільми англійскьою. Спочатку деякі деталі були не зрозумілі, але з часом, переводячи незнайомі слова та бачучи конкретні речення та як використовуються слова в контексті, мій рівень знань покращувався.I never started and, as a result, never stopped learning English. All my life I have not been shy about reading English articles or watching movies in English. At first, some details were not clear, but over time, translating unfamiliar words and seeing specific sentences and how words are used in context, my level of knowledge improved.\nNever\n\n\nВтрата мотивацій (лінь). Нудні заняття в групі. Однотипні заняття з викладачем (не нейтів).Loss of motivation (laziness). Boring group classes. Monotonous classes with a teacher (non-native).\nLoss of motivationPoor teaching or methods\n\n\n- коли почав працювати в укр компанії де англійська була непотрібна - коли мав перевантаження на роботі і втрату мотивації до вивчення- when I started working in a Ukrainian company where English was not needed - when I had overload at work and loss of motivation to learn\nNo practical needLack of timeLoss of motivation\n\n\nТак, об`єм роботиYes, workload\nLack of time\n\n\nI studied German.I studied German.\nPrioritizing another language\n\n\nНе було потреби її вдосконалювати чи використовувати. Перерва у 3 роки, поки не отримала роботу в ІТ.There was no need to improve or use it. A break of 3 years, until I got a job in IT.\nNo practical need\n\n\nне те, щоб припиняла, я постійно десь із нею стикаюсь і так було завжди з універу, тому припиняти не припиняла, але на курси я ходжу не завждиit's not that I stopped, I constantly encounter it somewhere and it has always been like that since university, so I didn't stop, but I don't always go to courses\nNever\n\n\nТак ы не раз. Брак часу.Yes, and more than once. Lack of time.\nLack of time\n\n\nВідсутність потреби і як наслідок мотиваціїLack of need and, as a result, motivation\nNo practical needLoss of motivation\n\n\nНе відчувала прогресу, а часу та засилб витрачала багато, тому треба перетерпіти цей період або спробувати знайти новий метод по вивченню - змінити викладача, методику, тематику занятьI didn't feel progress, and I spent a lot of time and effort, so I need to endure this period or try to find a new method of learning - change the teacher, methodology, subject of study\nLack of progressPoor teaching or methods\n\n\nТак, коли вивчала тільки для себе і вона ще не потрібна була для роботиYes, when I studied only for myself and it was not yet needed for work\nNo practical need\n\n\nТак, коли інша іноземна мова була більш пріоритетною за англійську на той моментYes, when another foreign language was more of a priority than English at that time\nPrioritizing another language\n\n\nСтавало нецікаво, вкладені зусилля не давали рівнозначного результату, тиск ззовні був неадекватно сильним, спричиняючи супротивIt became uninteresting, the efforts invested did not give an equivalent result, the external pressure was inadequately strong, causing resistance\nLoss of motivationLack of progressPoor teaching or methods\n\n\nНе припиняла, але погіршились знання і втратилась мотивація в початковій школі через вчителя з поганими методиками навчання (запам'ятовування текстів і розказування їх напам'ять тощо), але покращилось, коли його замінилиI didn't stop, but my knowledge deteriorated and I lost motivation in elementary school because of a teacher with poor teaching methods (memorizing texts and reciting them by heart, etc.), but it improved when he was replaced\nNever\n\n\nТак, ставало скучно і я не бачила прогресуYes, it became boring and I didn't see progress\nLoss of motivationLack of progress\n\n\nДа, бо не було стимулу та саме де її використовуватиYes, because there was no incentive and nowhere to use it\nLoss of motivationNo practical need\n\n\nТреба було вчити іншу мовуI had to learn another language\nPrioritizing another language\n\n\nЗавантаженість на работі чи в універі, ліньWorkload at work or university, laziness\nLack of timeLoss of motivation\n\n\nзакінчується натхненняinspiration ends\nLoss of motivation\n\n\nПрипиняв, так як не мав чіткої потреби у цьому, заняття проходили скучноI stopped because I didn't have a clear need for it, the classes were boring\nNo practical needPoor teaching or methods\n\n\n- Школа змінила стратегію. Поміняли контент на платформі. Стало більше АІ і менше фідбеку, вправ. Більше стало схоже на іграшку - Не підійшов вчитель - Не було балансу навичок. Нудна граматика або слова без їх використання - Гейміфікація більше ніж якість навчання. Я зрозуміла, що щось вчу, щоб побити когось у рейтингу. А звідти вчила як попало, але скоріше - Нецікавий контент (теми). Це прям каторга, змушуєш себе щось робити - Не відчувала результату. На місці товчешся - Не ходила на англійську на роботі, бо не хотіла обговорювати особисте з колегами. Некомфортно - Страх говорити з носіями- The school changed its strategy. They changed the content on the platform. There was more AI and less feedback, exercises. It became more like a toy - The teacher was not a good fit - There was no balance of skills. Boring grammar or words without using them - Gamification more than quality of education. I realized that I was learning something to beat someone in the ranking. And from there I learned haphazardly, but faster - Uninteresting content (topics). It's a real torture, you force yourself to do something - I didn't feel the result. You're spinning your wheels - I didn't go to English at work because I didn't want to discuss personal things with colleagues. Uncomfortable - Fear of speaking with native speakers\nPoor teaching or methodsLack of progress\n\n\nПрипиняла декілька раз, зазвичай причина була що не вистачало часу чи сил для виконання домашніх завдань. А без самостійної роботи результат не такий очевидний. Інший момент що насправді в роботі часто використовуєш одні й ті ж фрази, що доволі шаблонно і теж не сприяє розвутку.I stopped several times, usually the reason was that I didn't have enough time or energy to do homework. And without independent work, the result is not so obvious. Another point is that in work you often use the same phrases, which is quite шаблонно and also does not contribute to development.\nLack of timeLack of progressNo practical need\n\n\nПрипиняв через відсутність часу та спад мотивації через доволі довге вивчення з носіємI stopped due to lack of time and a decrease in motivation due to quite a long study with a native speaker\nLack of timeLoss of motivation\n\n\nНе було потребиThere was no need\nNo practical need\n\n\n1) Не було мети. 2) не бачила прогресу1) There was no goal. 2) I didn't see progress\nLack of a clear goalLack of progress\n\n\nПрипиняла, частіше за все тоді коли в роботі не була потрібна у розмовах чи листуваннях. І жалкував що припиняла, тому що без практики швидко забувається і навички губляться.I stopped, most often when it was not needed in work in conversations or correspondence. And I regretted that I stopped, because without practice it is quickly forgotten and skills are lost.\nNo practical need\n\n\nТак припиняв бо був дурним.Yes, I stopped because I was stupid.\nLoss of motivation\n\n\nМені потрібна була відпусткаI needed a vacation\nLoss of motivation\n\n\nI finished one course and was moved onto next one. I didn’t like either the new teacher, or new classmates (they didn’t like me too, I think).I finished one course and was moved onto next one.

Також з часом переглядаючи фільми англійською або ж просто з субтитрами ці нові вивчені слова частіше помічаєш. В подальшому планую займатись персонально з викладачем так як думаю що це найкращий спосіб підтягнути англійську але також важливо визначити конкретну потребу та який аспект варто покращити. Now I'm trying to at least move forward a little in learning English using word cards, and repeating learned words that are remembered quite well over time. Also, over time, watching movies in English or just with subtitles, you notice these new learned words more often. In the future, I plan to study individually with a teacher, as I think this is the best way to improve my English, but it is also important to determine the specific need and which aspect should be improved. \n\n\n Спроби говорити або намагится сприймати інформацію, фільми, книги, ігри англійською без попередніх знань мови. Attempts to speak or try to perceive information, movies, books, and games in English without prior knowledge of the language. \n\n\n спеціально підготовлені матеріали для drills, translating on the fly, q&a, над яким працюєш приблизно тиждень і працюєш вголос. drills - спікер читає текст англійською і робить паузи після кожного речення і тобі потрібно повторити речення translating on the fly - спікер читає речення українською і робить паузу, щоб ти переклав то це речення і після цього він читає це речення англійською і ти порівнюєш зі своїм варіантом q&a - спікер читає речення англійською і потім ставить англійською питання до цього речення, ти маєш дати відповідь на питання базуючись на реченні, що було прочитано, потім спікер читає правильну відповідь і ти порівнюєш зі своїм варіантом specially prepared materials for drills, translating on the fly, q&a, which you work on for about a week and work out loud. drills - the speaker reads the text in English and pauses after each sentence and you need to repeat the sentence translating on the fly - the speaker reads a sentence in Ukrainian and pauses for you to translate that sentence and then he reads that sentence in English and you compare with your version q&a - the speaker reads a sentence in English and then asks a question in English to that sentence, you have to answer the question based on the sentence that was read, then the speaker reads the correct answer and you compare with your version \n\n\n Інтенсивні онлайн курси на закріплення окремої навички Intensive online courses to consolidate a specific skill \n\n\n Youtube Youtube \n\n\n Quest, speaking with AI Quest, speaking with AI \n\n\n - — \n\n\n Пробую різні методики щоб було цікавіше: і пісні і фільми і різні вправи I try different methods to make it more interesting: songs, movies, and various exercises \n\n\n Читання статей та книг в комбінації з подальшим регулярним вивченням незнайомих слів Reading articles and books in combination with further regular learning of unfamiliar words \n\n\n Занурення в мовне середовище 😅 Або використання інтерактивних вправ де поєднється використання декількох навичок водночас (напр. читання + письмо + аудіювання) Immersion in the language environment 😅 Or the use of interactive exercises that combine the use of several skills at the same time (e.g. reading + writing + listening) \n\n\n за допомогою англійської вивчати інші мови (наприклад, в Дуо для вивчення французької як нейтів обрати англійську) using English to learn other languages (for example, in Duolingo, choose English as your native language to learn French) \n\n\n Коли неочікувано потрапляєш на вечірку, де всі говорять англійською, думаєш х100 швидше (навіть якщо трішки пʼяненький)👀 When you unexpectedly get to a party where everyone speaks English, you think x100 faster (even if you're a little tipsy)👀 \n\n\n Індивідуальні регулярні зустрічі з нейтівами Individual regular meetings with native speakers \n\n\n Ні, використовую загально відоме. Але хочу спробувати додаток з АІ No, I use the well-known ones. But I want to try an AI app \n\n\n Їхати у мовне середовище Going to a language environment \n\n\n Дуже ефективно: -Вчити когось, створювати навчальний контент. Поки складаєш матеріали і пояснюєш, сам згадуєш і практикуєш -Погрузити себе в англомовне середовище, де просто немає іншого варіанту як використовувати англійську -Ведення щоденника, блогу англійською, писати нотатки -Хоббі англійською -Зустрічі з друзями англійською -Ігри на кожен день. Люблю ДаНі грати або Корова) -Вчити іншу мову, де вчитель англійською пояснює. Я пробувала в італійську так зайти. Було цікаво:) Вчиш нове слово італійською, а питаєш англійською про правила використання, наприклад. Спадає напруга щось говорити англійською, згадуєш слова, думаєш англійською як рідною. Неефективно -10 застосунків одразу, складно системно так вивчати - Групи класичні. Мені завжди час шкода - Загальна ІТ англійська. Як дизайнеру мені не заходить вчити про токени з програмістами. В житті мало цього спілкування, в інтереси не попадає.. І вчитись стає нудно тому. А от small talk чи кризові комунікації- корисні теми.. Тут вибірково -Вчити слова без контексту -Робити 2 вправи на правило по новій граматиці. Начебто і зробив, а через тиждень забув. Добре якщо тренажери і до автоматизму, чи повторювати через інтервали Very effective: -Teaching someone, creating educational content. While you are compiling materials and explaining, you remember and practice yourself -Immerse yourself in an English-speaking environment where there is simply no other option but to use English -Keeping a diary, blog in English, writing notes -Hobbies in English -Meetings with friends in English -Games for every day. I love playing DaNi or Cow) -Learning another language, where the teacher explains in English. I tried to get into Italian like that. It was interesting:) You learn a new word in Italian, and you ask in English about the rules of use, for example. It relieves the tension of saying something in English, you remember words, you think in English like a native. Ineffective -10 applications at once, it is difficult to study systematically like that - Classic groups. I always feel sorry for the time - General IT English. As a designer, I don't like learning about tokens with programmers. There is little of this communication in life, it does not fall into my interests. And it becomes boring to learn because of this. But small talk or crisis communications are useful topics. Here selectively -Learning words without context -Doing 2 exercises on a rule for new grammar. It seems like you did it, but you forgot it a week later. It's good if there are simulators and to automatism, or repeat through intervals \n\n\n Повинна бути постійна практика використання вивченого матеріалу, інакше все швидко забувається, і те що використовується постійно в роботі, те краще закріплюється. There should be constant practice of using the learned material, otherwise everything is quickly forgotten, and what is used constantly in work is better consolidated. \n\n\n короткі відео з опитуванням слів різного рівня мені здалися доволі ефективними short videos with a survey of words of different levels seemed quite effective to me \n\n\n - — \n\n\n В моєму випадку працює лише практика реального спілкування. In my case, only real communication practice works. \n\n\n Подкасти Podcasts \n\n\n Preparations to English exams like IELTS/CELPIP Preparations to English exams like IELTS/CELPIP \n\n\n Ефективні - мовне середовище Неефективні - концентрація лише на одному з навичок (читання, слухання, граматика) Effective - language environment Ineffective - concentration on only one of the skills (reading, listening, grammar) \n\n\n Переїхати в англомовне оточення, практикувати кожен день. Все інше для галочки і ти можеш в більшості тільки підтримувати свій рівень. При заняттях регулярних з викладачем - можна покращувати потроху рівень і. відточувати граматіку Move to an English-speaking environment, practice every day. Everything else is for show and you can mostly only maintain your level. With regular classes with a teacher, you can gradually improve your level and hone your grammar \n\n\n Читання художньої літератури найбільш ефективний спосіб для мене збільшити словник, так відрефлексувати стилістику мовлення, ідіоми, граматику, тощо. Reading fiction is the most effective way for me to increase my vocabulary, to reflect on the style of speech, idioms, grammar, etc. \n\n\n twitter ефективний етимологічний словник ефективний twitter is effective etymological dictionary is effective \n\n\n ENG program ENG program \n\n\n повсякденне спілкування everyday communication \n\n\n Схоже, на вже згадане, але вирішив уточнити - перегляд відео/фільмів с субтитрами (англ. звук та англ. субтитри). І читаєш і слухаєш одночасно) Крім того вважаю непоганим встановлювати собі англійську мову як основну, де можливо (наприклад на телефоні). Це не дозволить вивчати \"нове\" але додає відчуття англомовного оточення) Similar to what has already been mentioned, but I decided to clarify - watching videos/movies with subtitles (English audio and English subtitles). You read and listen at the same time) In addition, I think it's a good idea to set English as the main language wherever possible (for example, on your phone). This will not allow you to learn \"new\" things, but it adds a sense of an English-speaking environment) \n\n\n Використання нейронних мереж (ChatGPT, Gemini) та інструментів (Grammarly) для перевірки та покращення граматики та структури письма Using neural networks (ChatGPT, Gemini) and tools (Grammarly) to check and improve grammar and writing structure \n\n\n Школа англійської з суворою авторською методикою. +рівень за 4 місяці Неефективні - будь-які додатки, корпоративні заняття English school with a strict author's methodology. +level in 4 months Ineffective - any applications, corporate classes \n\n\n Англомовне середовище, спілкування з носіями - виявилось найефективнішим серед багаторічного навчання з українськими викладачами English-speaking environment, communication with native speakers - turned out to be the most effective among many years of studying with Ukrainian teachers \n\n\n Перекласти текст улюбленої пісні та потім підспівувати з розумінням Translate the text of your favorite song and then sing along with understanding \n\n\n Вивчення анекдотів та дослівний переказ коротких смішних історії, багато вправ на аудіовання.
